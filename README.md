# Home Lab

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in setting up a **home lab** using a **Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q** and **Raspberry Pi 5**. The goal is to experiment with **system administration, networking, DevOps, and fleet management** while building a portfolio of hands-on projects.

## Objectives
- Learn **Linux system administration** by installing and configuring Debian.
- Develop **networking skills** using Netgear switches.
- Implement **fleet operations concepts** for enterprise-level system management.
- Experiment with **automation and scripting** using Python and Bash.
- Create a **GitHub repository** to document and share knowledge.

## Home Lab Setup
### Hardware
- **Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q** (Debian Server)
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (IoT & Fleet Operations Testing)
- **Netgear GS108 & GS105** (Networking)
- **TP-Link AC600 USB Wi-Fi Adapter**

### Software
- **Debian 12 (Server Edition)**
- **Python and Bash for automation**
- **Git for version control**
- **SSH for remote management**
- **MQTT for fleet communication**

## Projects & Documentation
1. **Debian Installation Guide** â€“ [Debian Installation](debian_installation.md)
2. **Network Configuration & VLAN Setup** *(coming soon)*
3. **Fleet Management with MQTT** *(coming soon)*
4. **Automated System Monitoring Scripts** *(coming soon)*

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kb35/home-lab.git
   cd home-lab
   ```
2. Read through the documentation and follow along.
3. Contribute by suggesting improvements or additional projects.

## Future Plans
- Automate system maintenance tasks.
- Set up projects on Raspberry Pi.
- Implement logging and monitoring tools.
- Explore LLMs.
